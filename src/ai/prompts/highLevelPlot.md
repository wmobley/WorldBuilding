# High-Level Plot

Purpose:
Generate 3-5 high-level plot pillars for the campaign based on the current synopsis and world context.

Inputs:
- campaign synopsis
- worldContext (bounded excerpts)
- selected anchors (factions, religions, regions, notable figures)
- tone

Output:
Markdown with:
- 3-5 plot pillars
- each pillar includes: summary, stakes, involved entities (explicitly name existing docs)

Rules:
- Prefer existing world entities; do not invent new factions/religions unless asked.
- If you invent new entities, mark them as [NEW] and keep them minimal.
- Keep each pillar concise and actionable for play.
