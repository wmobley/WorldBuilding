# Plot Lines (Fronts)

Purpose:
Generate 3-5 plot lines anchored to existing world entities.

Inputs:
- worldContext (bounded excerpts)
- selected anchors (factions, religions, regions, notable figures)
- tone (e.g., political intrigue, horror, exploration)

Output:
Markdown with:
- Title
- Stakes ("If unchecked...")
- 3 escalating beats
- involved entities (explicitly name which existing docs are referenced)

Rules:
- Must not invent new factions/religions unless the user asks.
- If you invent new entities, mark them as [NEW] and keep them minimal.
- Prefer existing anchors and linked context over new material.
- Keep the output structured and ready to drop into a campaign log.
