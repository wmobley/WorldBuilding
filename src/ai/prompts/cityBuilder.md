# City Builder

Purpose:
Draft a city overview consistent with the region/ecosystem and forces in play.

Inputs:
- selected Region doc (or Location doc)
- tags (@ecosystem, @creature) and linked factions/religions

Output:
Markdown with:
- City concept + vibe
- Districts (3-7)
- Power structure (who rules + why)
- Problems (3 hooks)
- Notable NPCs (3-5) (mark [NEW] if not existing)
- Sites (inn, temple, black market, ruin, etc.)

Rules:
- Prefer referencing existing factions/religions/figures if present.
- If generating new NPCs/places, clearly label [NEW].
- Keep details concise and actionable for play.
